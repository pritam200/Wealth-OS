@Entity
@Table(name = "refresh_tokens")
// Lombok's @Data generates equals, hashCode and toString over *every* field, including JPA
// relations. On an entity with a bidirectional mapping that recurses forever:
// Holding.hashCode() reads its portfolio, Portfolio.hashCode() reads its holdings list, which
// reads this holding again — a StackOverflowError, reproduced and confirmed before this fix.
// The same recursion applies to toString(), so simply logging an entity crashed the thread.
//
// On lazy relations it is also a LazyInitializationException (or a silent N+1) as soon as
// equals/hashCode is called outside a session.
//
// Identity is therefore the primary key alone, which is what JPA semantics actually mean by
// "the same row", and relations are excluded from toString.
